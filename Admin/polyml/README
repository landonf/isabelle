Poly/ML for Isabelle
====================

This is a preview of Poly/ML 5.6, based on
https://github.com/polyml/polyml/ commit 74a14cce7b20.

The included build script is used like this:

  ./build src x86-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86-windows --with-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-windows --with-gmp

Also note that the separate "sha1" library module is required for
efficient digesting of strings according to SHA-1.
