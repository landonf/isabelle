asynchronous print commands (e.g. Slegehammer provers).

* Structural composition of proof methods (meth1; meth2) in Isar.

* HOL: BNF datatypes and codatatypes are now standard.

* HOL: numerous tool improvements: Nitpick, Sledgehammer, SMT, including a
new free (!) version of Z3.

* HOL: numerous library refinements and enhancements.

* New proof method "rewrite" for single-step rewriting with subterm
selection based on patterns.

* New Eisbach proof method language and "match" method.

* Updated manuals: datatypes, implementation, isar-ref, jedit, sledgehammer,
