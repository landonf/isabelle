Subject: Announcing Isabelle2017
To: isabelle-users@cl.cam.ac.uk

Isabelle2017 is now available.

This version introduces many changes over Isabelle2016-1: see the NEWS
file for further details. Some notable points:

* Experimental support for Visual Studio Code as alternative PIDE front-end.

* Improved Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE: management of session sources
independently of editor buffers, removal of unused theories, explicit
indication of theory status, more careful auto-indentation.

* Session-qualified theory imports.

* Code generator improvements: support for statically embedded computations.

* Numerous HOL library improvements.

* More material in HOL-Algebra, HOL-Computational_Algebra and HOL-Analysis
(ported from HOL-Light).

* SQL database support in Isabelle/Scala.
