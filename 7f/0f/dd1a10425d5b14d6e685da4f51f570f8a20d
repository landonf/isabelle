Isabelle/VSCode is subject to dual-licensing:

  * BSD-3-Clause inherited by the overall Isabelle source license

  * MIT license for the src/extension part that is also published on
    the VSCode marketplace

MIT is slightly more liberal than BSD-3-Clause. This exception allows to
adopt the standard license scheme of the Node.js / VSCode universe for the
Isabelle/VScode extension module.
